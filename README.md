# Litsea

Litsea is an extremely compact word segmentation software inspired by [TinySegmenter](http://chasen.org/~taku/software/TinySegmenter/) written in Rust.

It features a fast and safe Rust implementation, performs word segmentation using a compact pre-trained model, and includes a learner with a simple and highly extensible design.

There is a small plant called Litsea cubeba (Aomoji) in the same camphoraceae family as Lindera (Kuromoji). This is the origin of the name Litsea.

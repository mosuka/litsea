# litsea

The project name Litsea is derived from its connection to the morphological analyzer Lindera (Kuromoji). Litsea is a Rust implementation of TinySegmenter that uses a lightweight pre-trained model, aiming to offer a simpler and more lightweight structure compared to conventional morphological analyzers, including Lindera.

Lindera (Kuromoji) is named after a plant in the Lauraceae family. Within the same family, there is a smaller plant known as Litsea cubeba, or "Aomoji" in Japanese. This is the origin of the name Litsea.

The naming reflects the concept of â€œthe same software for text processing as Lindera, but lighter and simpler.
